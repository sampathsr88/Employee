 data binding:
 -------------
   logincomponent                           template
        |                                      |
   logic to validate                          ...
    user acct                              <span id="s1"></span>
    [invalid]
       |
  msg="invalid name or password"

 document.getelementbyid("s1")
   .innerHtml=msg;

 manual approach          -->to be avoided---> databinding
 mixing html with logic                       [<span>{{msg}}</span>]

*establishing a relation between component[variable|method]
 and template[html] is called databinding
*the main advantage of databinding is avoiding manual coding to
 developer and seperating html from logic[provides readability and
 easy unit testing of component class]
*databinding can be classified into 2 types
  1.one way databinding
  2.two way databinding

one way databinding:
--------------------
*data flow from component to template (or) template to component is
 called "one way databinding"
*one way databinding can be implemented in different ways
  1.interpolation
  2.property binding
  3.style binding
  4.event binding
  5.attribute binding
