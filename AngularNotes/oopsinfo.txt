 oops[object oriented programming synopsis]
 ------------------------------------------
 *object oriented programming synopsis are 4 things
  1.data encapsulation
        combining|binding related fields and methods as one unit
        is called "data encapsulation"
    practical:
         class

  2.data abstraction
        hiding secured things|complexity is called "data abstraction"
     practical:
         object

   user|developer------> object             class
       |                   |                  |     
    can access           a and b           a-public                                            
    only a                                b-private

  3.inheritance
          creating new entity based on existing entity

  4.polymorphism--poly + morphism
                    |      |
                  many    forms
           many forms of a single object is called "polymorphism"
     practical:
           method overriding,overloading and interface
