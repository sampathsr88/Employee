 MPA[Multi Page Application] vs SPA[Single Page App]
 ---------------------------------------------------
 *web app[or website] with multiple pages,each page
  will have its own request to server and response
  to client is called MPA

   browser                     webserver
     |
 [masterpage|layoutpage]
  home about-------------------->aboutpage exec
                                    |
       contact                  layoutpage|masterpage 
                                    |
               <-----------------output[html+css+js]
 home about ..
      contact  ------------------->contactpage exec

  aboutpage info

 problems:
    ->each request will goto server,after execution
      server will provide response,browser will
      reload html,css and js
    ->response will be slow[performance will be
                            effected]
    ->it will not support offline exec

*web app[or website] with single mainpage and other
 pages will be loaded as a part of mainpage without
 reloading|refreshing mainpage is called SPA
   eg: gmail,youtube,..

  advs of spa:
    ->complete navigation will be in the client
      system
      [single page app works like desktop app in the
       client system,only initial req will goto server
       to download spa->angular app|react app]
    ->response will be faster,this leads to
      better performance
    ->it will avoid reloading html,css and javascript
    ->it works offline with the data available in
       client system

  drawbacks:
     ->it is not search friendly 
*the one and only one purpose of angular|react in
 realtime is to develop single page app
