 debugging in typescript:
 ------------------------
 *line by line execution to identify logical errors is called
  debugging
 *debugging typescript requires "debugger" keyword|statement and
  map file
 *debugger is a breakpoint to stop normal execution and control will
  be taken into debug mode
 
  <>.ts-->compile--><>.js------->webpage------>browser
                                                  |
                                            it will show js file for
                                            debugging,but our requirement
                                            is ts file
 *map file is a linker file between ts and js,it will execute typescript
  equivalent javascript code in the background
 * --sourceMap option is required with typescript compiler to
   generate map file
  syntax:
     tsc <>.ts --sourceMap
execution:
----------
*goto vs code and open typescript folder
*create new file
 debuggingdemo.ts
     |
 class c1
{
    m1(){
        console.log("method m1");
    }
    m2(){
        console.log("method m2");
    }
}
let obj=new c1();
obj.m1();
debugger;
obj.m2();
*goto terminal
  >tsc debuggingdemo.ts --sourceMap
 it will produce 2 files[debugingdemo.js and debuggingdemo.js.map]
*create new file
   debuggingdemo.html
          |
       <html>
        <head>
   <script src="debuggingdemo.js"></script>
       </head>
      </html>
*goto browser
 e:\angularbatch29\typescript\debuggingdemo.html

*rc on browser document area and select inspect
*refresh webpage------->sources
                          |
                       debuggingdemo.ts
                          ...
                     ->debugger;

*select f8 to perform line by line execution
