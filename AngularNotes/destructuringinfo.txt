 destructuring in typescript:
 ----------------------------
 *assigning array elements to normal variables in a simplified way
  is called "destructuring"

   eg:
    let cities=["hyd","bang","mumbai","chennai"];

    var city1=cities[0];  -->normal approach
    var city2=cities[1];


    var[city1,city2]=cities;  ->destructuring
          |       |
    assigned with 2nd element
     1st element

    var[city1,,city3]=cities;
         |       |
      1st ele  3rd element
 *destructuring is supported by es6 and typescript

example:
--------
*goto vs code and open typescript folder
*create new file
   destructuringdemo.ts
          |
 var cities=["hyd","bang","chennai","mumbai"];

var[city1,city2,city3,city4,city5,city6]=cities;//no error[city5 and city6 will not be assigned with any data]
console.log(city1,city2);


var[city1,,city3]=cities;
console.log(city1,city3);

var[city1,...others]=cities; //spread operator makes others var as an array,this will receive all the elements other than 1st element
console.log(city1,others);

var mobiles:string[]=["samsung","htc"];
var laptops:string[]=["dell","hp"];
var prods:string[]=[...mobiles,...laptops]; //merging 2 arrays into a single array
console.log(prods);
//mutable and immutable
/*var cities1=cities;//["hyd","bang","chennai","mumbai"] -->mutable array
cities1[0]="hyderabad";
console.log(cities[0]);//hyderabad  */

var cities1=[...cities];  //-->immutable array
cities1[0]="hyderabad";
console.log(cities[0]);//hyd

 *goto terminal
  >tsc destructuringdemo.ts
  >node destructuringdemo
       ...

 note:
 -----
 1.mutable and immutable array
    ->the array or variable which will change orginal copy is
      called mutable
    
      cities1=cities;

      cities ------------->  hyd bang chennai mumbai

      cities1------------->
 
    ->the array or variable orginal copy will not be changed is
      called "immutable",this can be implemented using spread
      operator
        cities=[...cities];

      cities---------------->hyd  bang chennai mumbai


     cities1--------------->hyd bang  chennai mumabi

      cities1[0]="hyderabad";

      mutable-->orginal copy will be modified
   immutable --->orginal copy will not be modified[spread operator]

linking js file to a webpage:
-----------------------------
*create a new file
   destructuringdemo.html
           |
     <html>
       <head>
         <script src="destructuringdemo.js">
         </script>
       </head>
     </html>
*rc on editor area and select open with live server
 [it will open current html page with browser]

*rc on browser document area and select inspect [or go with f12]
*select console tab
         ...

     array(3) [expand]
         ...
