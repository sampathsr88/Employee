 intro angular:
 --------------
 *angular is an open source typescript framework to develop web app
  and mobile app
 *ionic mobile framework will use angular for mobile app development
 *angular in realtime is used for single page app[SPA]
 *web app with single mainpage and other pages will be loaded as a
  part of mainpage without reloading|refreshing mainpage
  is called SPA
      eg:gmail,..
 *SPA will provide better performance with faster response and
  works offline with the data available
 *angular is not an extension to angularjs,it is completly
  rebuilt from ground level using typescript language
 *angular is provided by google in the year 2015 as beta version,
  the stable release if provided in the year 2016
 *the current version is angular10[june 25 2020] 

angular features:
-----------------
1.component based architecture
    the main importance of component based arch is simplifying
    complex ui,this provides reusability,easy maintenance,
    loosely coupled|parallel development and unit testing will be easy

       webpage
         |
          header-->component

 sidebar   ...

         footer-->component

  note:
   ->angularjs is a mvc based architecture,it is complex arch
   ->it is similar component based arch of reactjs

2.object oriented programming support
     what ever we develop in angular will be in the form of a class[typescript]
   eg:
     ->component class
     ->module class
     ->pipe class
             ....

   note:
     angularjs doesn't support object oriented programming

3.better performance
    angular provides 5+ times better performance over angularjs

4.data binding
     establishing a relation between a variable and control[html element] is
     is called data binding
                 this will provide variable value to html element and
     html element[textbox] changes to variable automatically without
     manual coding,this makes developer job easy and faster development

   price variable
       |
      100                           textbox[<input id="t1">]

      document.getElementById("t1").value=price;
            or
      $("#t1").val(price);

    textbox-->input event-->f1(){
                      price=$("#t1").val();
          |
  this is manual approach
          |
  this can be avoided in angular using databinding
  <input .. [(ngModel)]="price">
                |
           databinding
5.validations support
    angular is providing builtin code to perform different types
    of validations,this makes developer job easy and faster development
             angular supports 2 types of validations
      i.MDF[Model Driven Form] validations
     ii.TDF[Template Driven Form] validations

6.server side development support
      angular supports client and server side web app development
             angular universal technology|framework is provided by
     angular team for server side web development by integrating
     with expressjs@nodejs
    https://angular.io/guide/universal

7.more languages support
     angular supports different languages for programming
      [like javascript,dart and typescript]

         dart-->provided by google

8.animations support

9.routing support
     this is used to provide navigation between components with in
     angular app,this allows single page app[SPA] development

10.tooling support
      angular is providing "angular cli" tool to make
      development easy and faster

11.ajax support
       angular is providing httpclient service to work with ajax to
       call restapi to communicate with database
  
  browser
  angular                  webserver           sqlserver|mongodb|mysql
   app   ---->ajax------> restapi class--------->database
                       [webapi,expressjs,..]

12.angular material
      this is a UI component library to provide rich user intraction
      with better look and feel

      bootstrap-->twitter

      angular material-->google[angular team]
                 |
      native to angular

13.service support with dependency injection[DI]
